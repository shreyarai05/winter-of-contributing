# winter-of-contributing
GirlScript Winter of Contributing is a three-month-long Open-Source Program organized byðŸ§¡GirlScript Foundation to create the world's largest multilingual content repository that will be available to everyone. 
This is about explaining plotly and cufflinks library for data visualisation in python.
It has codes explaining how to plot different graphs and charts.
Plotly will be used for visualising different data and plotting its graph.I have used cufflinks for binding plotly with jupyter notebook.
Using librarries of plotly we have plotted numerous plots which enables getting insight in the data we are observing .
Based on the type of data we have, plotting graph according to that has been achieved .
Advantages:
1) User can zoom in ,zoom out and it is interactive .
2) Allows customisation and flexibility which determines how many and which graph area to be visible.
3) Provides huge range of charts an graphs as compared to other visualisation libraries.
